LinkSmartXMLDatabase Readme - Michael Crouch (UR)

This bundle exposes the eXist XMLDB libraries to the OSGi Framework. 

This removes the need for bundles, such as the Policy Decision Point, by 
packaging the eXist libraries in their own bundle rather using the eXist 
libraries separately.

The process of creating an XML database through this bundle is currently not 
very user friendly. An external conf.xml file is required at the location 
specified when using the ExistDatabaseManager class.

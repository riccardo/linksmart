		This Configuration XML file enables the solution developer to specify
		the requirements for PULLing data from devices.
		
		If a device does not provide contextual information through the Event
		mechanism (using the Event Manager), then it may be desired for the
		Context Manager to PULL this data from it, at a given frequency.
		
		This configuration allows for the definition of WHAT should be pulled,
		and at what frequency. This can refer to StateVariables under types of 
		devices, or units etc.
	 -->
	 
	 <!-- Example Requirement
	 	<requirement>
	 		<matchDevice>
	 			<deviceXPath>//DeviceClass/text()</deviceXPath>
	 			<matchTo>[insertRegEx]</matchTo>
	 		</matchDevice>
	 		<pullActions>
	 			<stateVariable frequency="50000">[regEx]</stateVariable>
	 		</pullActions>
	 	</requirement>	 
	 -->
	 
	 <!-- 
	 	The 'matchDevice' element allows for matching the device in question,
	 	by matching the results of an XPath query, against a regEx expression 
	 -->
	 
	 
	 <!--
	 	This configuration file also contains the configurations for the additional
	 	"LinkSmart" services for devices, such as the Energy / Power / Location services.
	 	
	 	These configurations describe how these services should be handled by the 
	 	Context Manager.

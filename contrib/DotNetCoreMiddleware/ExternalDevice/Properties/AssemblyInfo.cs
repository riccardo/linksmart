 * 2. Licensor's liability for gross negligence is limited to foreseeable, contractually typical damages.
 * 3. Licensor shall not be liable for damages caused by slight negligence, except in cases 
 *    of violation of essential contractual obligations (cardinal obligations). Licensee's claims for 
 *    such damages shall be statute barred within 12 months subsequent to the delivery of the software.

 * This limitation of liability shall also apply if this license agreement shall be subject to law 
 * stipulating liability clauses corresponding to German law.
